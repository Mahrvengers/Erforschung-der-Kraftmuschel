    Day 7 : Adding commands

#>

<#

    For this lab, you have only one task: Run the Networking troubleshooting pack.
    When you successfully do so, you'll be asked for an Instance ID. Hit Enter, run
    a WebConnectivityCheck, and ask for help connection to a specific web page. 
    Use www.pluralsight.com/browse/it-ops as your test URL. We hope you get a 
    "No problems were detected" report, meaning you ran the check successfully.

    To accomplish this task, you need to discover a command capable of getting a troubleshooting
    pack, and another capable of executing a troubleshooting pack. You also need
    to discover where the packs are located and how they're named. Everything
    you need to know is in Powershell, and the help system will find it for you.

    That's all the help you will get!
